#  Jimmy

## A gemini client for MacOS

Jimmy is a native gemini client for MacOs, written in SwiftUI. It aims to be lightweight and efficient, while having a design that integrates perfectly with MacOs

It is currently a very early prototype, and not much works yet.

What does work: 

- Basic navigation and error handling
- Multiple tabs
- Display of text and links

What does not work:

- Images and other content types
- Link handling sometimes flaky, needs proper parser
