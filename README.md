#  Jimmy

## A gemini client for MacOS

Jimmy is a native gemini client for MacOs, written in SwiftUI. It aims to be lightweight and efficient, while having a design that integrates perfectly with MacOs

It is currently a very early prototype, and not much works yet.

What does work: 

- Basic navigation and error handling
- Multiple tabs
- Display of text and links

What does not work:

- Images and other content types
- Link handling sometimes flaky, needs proper parser

## Installation

Download the latest release zip file from [here](https://github.com/jfoucher/Jimmy/releases/latest), unzip and place the app in your Applications folder. You may have to right-click the app and choose open, as well as click through a few scary dialogs because I am not sure I can sign it properly without paying Apple 99â‚¬ for the privilege.
